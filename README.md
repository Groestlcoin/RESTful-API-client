## AtomicPay REST API
AtomicPay provides a standard HTTP RESTful interface which enables application developers to programmatically interact with their account in a powerful, yet secure environment. Using the AtomicPay API, clients can create and manage invoices, retrieve transaction information, access features, retrieve real-time currency rates, manage bills, and much more.

This Git repository contains code examples on how to make requests to AtomicPay RESTful API for various programming languages, including C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, NodeJS, PHP, Python, Ruby and Shell scripting. Future updates include easy-to-use code library for each programming languages. If you are interested to develop open source library for any of the languages, please read our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/atomicpay/RESTful-API-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or contact us via [Telegram](https://t.me/atomicpay) or email to support@atomicpay.io

With your choice of programming language, you can integrate AtomicPay cryptocurrency payment solution into Vending Machines, Smart TV apps, Point-of-Sale Systems, Games, Mobile Apps with in-store purchases, Paywalls for media sites and lots more. Do share with us, if you are building anything with AtomicPay API. 

Here are some Open Source ecommerce plugins that we built with AtomicPay API: [WooCommerce](https://github.com/atomicpay/woocommerce-plugin), [PrestaShop](https://github.com/atomicpay/prestashop-plugin), [OpenCart](https://github.com/atomicpay/opencart-plugin)

## Documentation
Full & Comprehensive API Documentation is available on the [AtomicPay website](https://atomicpay.io/api/en).

## Getting Started
Developers do not need to install additional libraries or softwares. Developers may call the API directly over HTTPS via protocol methods GET, PUT, POST and DELETE to perform operations, using the language of their choice.

In order to use AtomicPay Restful interface, you will need to sign up for an API key. **More information at** https://atomicpay.io/api/en

## Getting Access
Authorization in AtomicPay's API utilizes a set of revocable API Keys. Each API call must be accompanied by an Authorization header that include either a public or private API Key which grants access to perform specific operations.

You can retrieve the API keys by [login to merchant control panel](https://merchant.atomicpay.io/) -> API Integration page. If your key becomes compromised, you may revoke the keys by regenerating new set of keys.

To access any resource URI, an API Key will need to be sent within the HTTP headers Authorization: BASIC {AccountID}:{APIKey} **encoded in base64** over SSL along with the API body request.

## Making Requests
Requests to the AtomicPay REST API follow the RESTful convention using standard HTTP protocols against AtomicPay resources URI to return JSON formatted responses. **IMPORTANT:** (AccountID:APIKey) must be encoded in base64

Except for Authorization endpoint, each request MUST include in the HTTP headers:

- `Authorization: BASIC {AccountID}:{APIKey}`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

To make an API request, simply send an HTTP request with a HTTP method to a resource URI and include in the body JSON parameters of any additional parameters required.

## Resources URI
Below is a list of resources URI endpoints. For more information about specific resource URIs, please visit our [API Resource Documentation](https://atomicpay.io/api/en#resources).

### Authorization
Authorization endpoint URI allows client to validate the authentication of API Keys.

| Method | URI Endpoint |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| POST | https://merchant.atomicpay.io/api/v1/authorization |

For detailed schema, parameters, code snippet and returned responses, read [Authorization Resource Documentation](https://atomicpay.io/api/en#resource-Authorization)

### Account
Account endpoint URI allows client to retrieve or update account details of merchant's AtomicPay account.

| Method | URI Endpoint |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| GET | https://merchant.atomicpay.io/api/v1/account |
| PUT | https://merchant.atomicpay.io/api/v1/account |

For detailed schema, parameters, code snippet and returned responses, read [Account Resource Documentation](https://atomicpay.io/api/en#resource-Account)

### Billing
Billing endpoint URI allows client to retrieve details of a specific bill or a list of bills for the merchant account filtered by query.

| Method | URI Endpoint |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| GET | https://merchant.atomicpay.io/api/v1/billing |
| GET | https://merchant.atomicpay.io/api/v1/billing/:bill_id |
